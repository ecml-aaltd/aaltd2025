## Abstract

Anomaly detection is an important problem in data analytics with applications in many domains. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in anomaly detection tasks applied to time series. In this talk, we take a holistic view of anomaly detection in time series, discussing the challenges and research opportunities in this field. In addition, we will focus on the challenges related to anomaly detection in heterogeneous time series datasets, as well as on the new research opportunities related to Model Selection and Ensembling.
